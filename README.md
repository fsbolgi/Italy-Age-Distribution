# AGE DISTRIBUTION IN ITALY

This project was done for the exam of Scientific and Large Data Visualization in the master degree of Computer Science in the University of Pisa.

It's an interactive tool to visualize the distribution of the Italian population in the period from 1952 to 2065.
It is possible to inspect the data relative to the national territory, the regions and, for the restricted period of 1982-2017, the provinces and the municipalities.

Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. 
This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.


The data used was taken from the istat database. 
For the provinces and municipalities are available the data from 1982 to 2017, while for the regions it is also possible to see the reconstructed population from 1952 to 1981 and the forecasts until 2065.

It was written using the JavaScript library D3.js for manipulating documents based on data. D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a DOM, and then apply data-driven transformations to create interactive and smooth transitions.
